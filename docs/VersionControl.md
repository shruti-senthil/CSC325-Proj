## Source Code Version Control Tools

# Introduction
Version control is an aspect of software development that facilitates the management of code changes throughout the development process. Version control ensures the
integrity of a codebase by keeping track of changes made by different developers over time. It allows developers to revert back to previous changes if new changes bring about bugs or issues, thus reducing the risk of code conflicts and maintaining a more stable codebase. Version control systems maintain the history of all changes made to a codebase, which is valuable for understanding the evolution of the project. It also facilitates collaboration among team members by providing mechanisms for seamless sharing and synchronization of code. Developers can branch off and work on different aspects of the project simultaneously. Changes made by different developers can be merged into the main codebase.

# Version Control System Used
For my project, I have chosen to use Git as my version control system. There are many benefits to using Git, as it is a very powerful and commonly used version control system. To begin with, Git allows every developer working on the project to have a complete copy of the repository and it's full history. Git also has merging and branching capabilities that allow developers to easily create branches to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Merging these changes after working on them in another branch minimizes the risk of conflicts. Another benefit of Git is its speed and efficiency. The process of committing, branching, and merging is typically fast and doesn't slow down the development process. Overall, I have chosen to use Git because of its efficiency, way of organization, vast ecosystem of tools, plugins, and integrations, and because I already have a bit of familiarity with it, seeing as it is very commonly used.
